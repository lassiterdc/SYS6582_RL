  abstract = {Flooding in coastal cities is increasing due to climate change and sea-level rise, stressing the traditional stormwater systems these communities rely on. Automated real-time control (RTC) of these systems can improve performance, and creating control policies for smart stormwater systems is an active area of study. This research explores reinforcement learning (RL) to create control policies to mitigate flood risk. RL is trained using a model of hypothetical urban catchments with a tidal boundary and two retention ponds with controllable valves. RL's performance is compared to the passive system, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy, and a rule-based control strategy (RBC). RL learns to proactively manage pond levels using current and forecast conditions and reduced flooding by 32\% over the passive system. Compared to the MPC approach using a physics-based model and genetic algorithm, RL achieved nearly the same flood reduction, just 3\% less than MPC, with a significant 88× speedup in runtime. Compared to RBC, RL was able to quickly learn similar control strategies and reduced flooding by an additional 19\%. This research demonstrates that RL can effectively control a simple system and offers a computationally efficient method that could scale to RTC of more complex stormwater systems.},

  abstract = {Flooding poses a significant and growing risk for many urban areas. Stormwater systems are typically used to control flooding, but are traditionally passive (i.e. have no controllable components). However, if stormwater systems are retrofitted with valves and pumps, policies for controlling them in real-time could be implemented to enhance system performance over a wider range of conditions than originally designed for. In this paper, we propose an autonomous, reinforcement learning (RL) based, stormwater control system that aims to minimize flooding during storms. With this approach, an optimal control policy can be learned by letting an RL agent interact with the system in response to received reward signals. In comparison with a set of static control rules, RL shows superior performance on a wide range of artificial storm events. This demonstrates RL's ability to learn control actions based on observation and interaction, a key benefit for dynamic and ever-changing urban areas.},

  abstract = {The deployment of real-time control (RTC) technology has improved the performance of stormwater management facilities. However, most of the current research focuses on individual pilot sites. The major challenge hindering the upscaling of RTC deployment is the lack of a theoretical framework that guides real-time operation of a network of interconnected reservoirs. This study suggests a hybrid approach for enhancing a systemwide operation. The proposed model coupled a real-time control algorithm using two dynamic reservoir-release components with static releases from the storm water management model (SWMM5). This model was applied to the Merrybrook Run watershed in Fairfax County, Virginia. The results showed enhanced system performance and better use of available latent storage to mitigate downstream impacts.},

  abstract = {A new generation of smart stormwater systems promises to reduce the need for new construction by enhancing the performance of the existing infrastructure through real-time control. Smart stormwater systems dynamically adapt their response to individual storms by controlling distributed assets, such as valves, gates, and pumps. This paper introduces a real-time control approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which has emerged as a state-of-the-art methodology for autonomous control in the artificial intelligence community. Using a Deep Neural Network, a RL-based controller learns a control strategy by interacting with the system it controls - effectively trying various control strategies until converging on those that achieve a desired objective. This paper formulates and implements a RL algorithm for the real-time control of urban stormwater systems. This algorithm trains a RL agent to control valves in a distributed stormwater system across thousands of simulated storm scenarios, seeking to achieve water level and flow set-points in the system. The algorithm is first evaluated for the control of an individual stormwater basin, after which it is adapted to the control of multiple basins in a larger watershed (4\,km2). The results indicate that RL can very effectively control individual sites. Performance is highly sensitive to the reward formulation of the RL agent. Generally, more explicit guidance led to better control performance, and more rapid and stable convergence of the learning process. While the control of multiple distributed sites also shows promise in reducing flooding and peak flows, the complexity of controlling larger systems comes with a number of caveats. The RL controller’s performance is very sensitive to the formulation of the Deep Neural Network and requires a significant amount of computational resource to achieve a reasonable performance enhancement. Overall, the controlled system significantly outperforms the uncontrolled system, especially across storms of high intensity and duration. A frank discussion is provided, which should allow the benefits and drawbacks of RL to be considered when implementing it for the real-time control of stormwater systems. An open source implementation of the full simulation environment and control algorithms is also provided.},

  abstract = {Low-lying, low-relief coastal cities have seen increased flooding due to climate change. In these cities, stormwater pipe outlets can be inundated by coastal waters at high tide or from storm surge, making drainage impossible. The objective of this research is to assess the utility of model predictive control (MPC) of stormwater actuators to reduce flooding in a coastal urban setting made worse by sea level rise. The stormwater system and the control scenarios are simulated using the United States Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) coupled with a Python library, swmm\_mpc. The study area is Norfolk, Virginia, USA, a city which is particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding. A simulated 2-year 12-h design storm and sea level rise scenarios up to 3.5~ft are applied to the model for three control scenarios: 1) a passive system, 2) a passive system with a tide gate (backflow preventer), and 3) a tide gate and three actuators (a pump, a valve, and an inflatable dam) controlled through MPC. Flooding in the passive system reached a tipping point and increased dramatically after a sea level rise of 1.6~ft. The addition of a tide gate greatly mitigated this increase in flooding. MPC further reduced overall flooding with an average effective percent reduction of 32\%. The rate of the increase in flooding was significantly smaller with MPC than without. MPC also reduced maximum node flood volume by an average of 52\% for sea level increases of 2.0~ft and above. In addition to the installation of a tide gate, our results suggest that the use of actuators controlled by MPC could significantly reduce overall flood volumes and reduce flood severity at individual nodes in coastal cities.},

  abstract = {Flooding in many areas is becoming more prevalent due to factors such as urbanization and climate change, requiring modernization of stormwater infrastructure. Retrofitting standard passive systems with controllable valves/pumps is promising, but requires real-time control (RTC). One method of automating RTC is reinforcement learning (RL), a general technique for sequential optimization and control in uncertain environments. The notion is that an RL algorithm can use inputs of real-time flood data and rainfall forecasts to learn a policy for controlling the stormwater infrastructure to minimize measures of flooding. In real-world conditions, rainfall forecasts and other state information are subject to noise and uncertainty. To account for these characteristics of the problem data, we implemented Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), an RL algorithm that is distinguished by its capability to handle noise in the input data. DDPG implementations were trained and tested against a passive flood control policy. Three primary cases were studied: (i) perfect data, (ii) imperfect rainfall forecasts, and (iii) imperfect water level and forecast data. Rainfall episodes (100) that caused flooding in the passive system were selected from 10 years of observations in Norfolk, Virginia, USA; 85 randomly selected episodes were used for training and the remaining 15 unseen episodes served as test cases. Compared to the passive system, all RL implementations reduced flooding volume by 70.5\% on average, and performed within a range of 5\%. This suggests that DDPG is robust to noisy input data, which is essential knowledge to advance the real-world applicability of RL for stormwater RTC.},
