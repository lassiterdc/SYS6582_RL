The objective of the MPC is to apply a proactive management strategy that uses optimised time-state schedules for operating the actuators of UDS in real time. Aiming to mitigate flooding consequences, the MPC uses EPA-SWMM hydrologic-hydraulic simulation engine and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise the time-state schedules for the actuators of UDS. The efficiency of the MPC was tested on the Lille University Campus, resulting in satisfying improvements in the use of storage capacity of retention elements within the UDS.},

  abstract = {In dynamic real-time control (RTC) of regional water systems, a multicriteria optimization problem has to be solved to determine the optimal control strategy. Nonlinear and/or dynamic programming based on simulation models can be used to find the solution, an approach being used in the Aquarius decision support system (DSS) developed in The Netherlands. However, the computation time required for complex models is often prohibitively long, and therefore such a model cannot be applied in RTC of water systems. In this study, Aquarius DSS is chosen as a reference model for building a controller using machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and reinforcement learning (RL), where RL is used to decrease the error of the ANN-based component. The model was tested with complex water systems in The Netherlands, and very good results were obtained. The general conclusion is that a controller, which has learned to replicate the optimal control strategy, can be used in RTC operations.},

  abstract = {Flooding in coastal cities is increasing due to climate change and sea-level rise, stressing the traditional stormwater systems these communities rely on. Automated real-time control (RTC) of these systems can improve performance, and creating control policies for smart stormwater systems is an active area of study. This research explores reinforcement learning (RL) to create control policies to mitigate flood risk. RL is trained using a model of hypothetical urban catchments with a tidal boundary and two retention ponds with controllable valves. RL's performance is compared to the passive system, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy, and a rule-based control strategy (RBC). RL learns to proactively manage pond levels using current and forecast conditions and reduced flooding by 32\% over the passive system. Compared to the MPC approach using a physics-based model and genetic algorithm, RL achieved nearly the same flood reduction, just 3\% less than MPC, with a significant 88× speedup in runtime. Compared to RBC, RL was able to quickly learn similar control strategies and reduced flooding by an additional 19\%. This research demonstrates that RL can effectively control a simple system and offers a computationally efficient method that could scale to RTC of more complex stormwater systems.},

  abstract = {Although being one of the most popular and extensively studied approaches to design water reservoir operations, Stochastic Dynamic Programming is plagued by a dual curse that makes it unsuitable to cope with large water systems: the computational requirement grows exponentially with the number of state variables considered (curse of dimensionality) and an explicit model must be available to describe every system transition and the associated rewards/costs (curse of modeling). A variety of simplifications and approximations have been devised in the past, which, in many cases, make the resulting operating policies inefficient and of scarce relevance in practical contexts. In this paper, a reinforcement-learning approach, called fitted Q-iteration, is presented: it combines the principle of continuous approximation of the value functions with a process of learning off-line from experience to design daily, cyclostationary operating policies. The continuous approximation, performed via tree-based regression, makes it possible to mitigate the curse of dimensionality by adopting a very coarse discretization grid with respect to the dense grid required to design an equally performing policy via Stochastic Dynamic Programming. The learning experience, in the form of a data set generated combining historical observations and model simulations, allows us to overcome the curse of modeling. Lake Como water system (Italy) is used as study site to infer general guidelines on the appropriate setting for the algorithm parameters and to demonstrate the advantages of the approach in terms of accuracy and computational effectiveness compared to traditional Stochastic Dynamic Programming.},

  abstract = {Flooding poses a significant and growing risk for many urban areas. Stormwater systems are typically used to control flooding, but are traditionally passive (i.e. have no controllable components). However, if stormwater systems are retrofitted with valves and pumps, policies for controlling them in real-time could be implemented to enhance system performance over a wider range of conditions than originally designed for. In this paper, we propose an autonomous, reinforcement learning (RL) based, stormwater control system that aims to minimize flooding during storms. With this approach, an optimal control policy can be learned by letting an RL agent interact with the system in response to received reward signals. In comparison with a set of static control rules, RL shows superior performance on a wide range of artificial storm events. This demonstrates RL's ability to learn control actions based on observation and interaction, a key benefit for dynamic and ever-changing urban areas.},

  abstract = {Despite all the progress made over the years on developing automatic methods for analysing hydrographs and measuring the performance of rainfall–runoff models, automatic methods cannot yet match the power and flexibility of the human eye and brain. Very simple approaches are therefore being developed that mimic the way hydrologists inspect and interpret hydrographs, including the way that patterns are recognised, links are made by eye, and hydrological responses and errors are studied and remembered. In this paper, a dynamic programming algorithm originally designed for use in data mining is customised for use with hydrographs. It generates sets of “rays” that are analogous to the visual links made by the hydrologist’s eye when linking features or times in one hydrograph to the corresponding features or times in another hydrograph. One outcome from this work is a new family of performance measures called “visual” performance measures. These can measure differences in amplitude and timing, including the timing errors between simulated and observed hydrographs in model calibration. To demonstrate this, two visual performance measures, one based on the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency and the other on the mean absolute error, are used in a total of 34 split-sample calibration–validation tests for two rainfall–runoff models applied to the Hodder catchment, northwest England. The customised algorithm, called the Hydrograph Matching Algorithm, is very simple to apply; it is given in a few lines of pseudocode.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

This paper reviews more than 30 years of partly heterogeneous research on the topic. We propose a terminology for MPC of urban drainage systems and a hierarchical categorization where we emphasize four overall components: the “receding horizon principle”, the “optimization model”, the “optimization solver”, and the “internal MPC model”. Most of the reported optimization models share the trait of a multiobjective optimization based on a conceptual internal MPC model. However, there is a large variety of both convex and non-linear optimization models and optimization solvers as well as constructions of the internal MPC model. Furthermore, literature disagrees about the optimal length of the components in the receding horizon principle. The large number of MPC formulations and evaluation approaches makes it problematic to compare different MPC methods. This review highlights methods, challenges, and research gaps in order to make MPC of urban drainage systems accessible for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines. This will pave the way for shared understanding and further development within the field, and eventually lead to more operational implementations.},

However, there has been limited synthesis between shared problem traits, common EA challenges, and needed advances across major applications. This paper clarifies the current status and future research directions for better solving key water resources problems using EAs. Advances in understanding fitness landscape properties and their effects on algorithm performance are critical.

  abstract = {A new generation of smart stormwater systems promises to reduce the need for new construction by enhancing the performance of the existing infrastructure through real-time control. Smart stormwater systems dynamically adapt their response to individual storms by controlling distributed assets, such as valves, gates, and pumps. This paper introduces a real-time control approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which has emerged as a state-of-the-art methodology for autonomous control in the artificial intelligence community. Using a Deep Neural Network, a RL-based controller learns a control strategy by interacting with the system it controls - effectively trying various control strategies until converging on those that achieve a desired objective. This paper formulates and implements a RL algorithm for the real-time control of urban stormwater systems. This algorithm trains a RL agent to control valves in a distributed stormwater system across thousands of simulated storm scenarios, seeking to achieve water level and flow set-points in the system. The algorithm is first evaluated for the control of an individual stormwater basin, after which it is adapted to the control of multiple basins in a larger watershed (4\,km2). The results indicate that RL can very effectively control individual sites. Performance is highly sensitive to the reward formulation of the RL agent. Generally, more explicit guidance led to better control performance, and more rapid and stable convergence of the learning process. While the control of multiple distributed sites also shows promise in reducing flooding and peak flows, the complexity of controlling larger systems comes with a number of caveats. The RL controller’s performance is very sensitive to the formulation of the Deep Neural Network and requires a significant amount of computational resource to achieve a reasonable performance enhancement. Overall, the controlled system significantly outperforms the uncontrolled system, especially across storms of high intensity and duration.

  abstract = {Active stormwater control will play an increasingly important role in mitigating urban flooding, which is becoming more common with climate change and sea level rise. In this paper we describe and demonstrate swmm\_mpc, software developed for simulating model predictive control (MPC) for urban drainage systems using open source software (Python and the EPA Stormwater Management Model version 5 (SWMM5)). Swmm\_mpc uses an evolutionary algorithm as an optimizer and supports parallel processing. In the demonstration case for a hypothetical, tidally-influenced urban drainage system, the swmm\_mpc control policies for two storage units achieved its objectives of 1) practically eliminating flooding and 2) maintaining the water level at the storage units close to a target level. Although the current swmm\_mpc workflow was feasible for a simple model using a desktop PC, a high-performance computer or cloud-based computer with more computational cores would likely be needed for most real-world models.},

  abstract = {Low-lying, low-relief coastal cities have seen increased flooding due to climate change. In these cities, stormwater pipe outlets can be inundated by coastal waters at high tide or from storm surge, making drainage impossible. The objective of this research is to assess the utility of model predictive control (MPC) of stormwater actuators to reduce flooding in a coastal urban setting made worse by sea level rise. The stormwater system and the control scenarios are simulated using the United States Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) coupled with a Python library, swmm\_mpc. The study area is Norfolk, Virginia, USA, a city which is particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding. A simulated 2-year 12-h design storm and sea level rise scenarios up to 3.5~ft are applied to the model for three control scenarios: 1) a passive system, 2) a passive system with a tide gate (backflow preventer), and 3) a tide gate and three actuators (a pump, a valve, and an inflatable dam) controlled through MPC. Flooding in the passive system reached a tipping point and increased dramatically after a sea level rise of 1.6~ft. The addition of a tide gate greatly mitigated this increase in flooding. MPC further reduced overall flooding with an average effective percent reduction of 32\%. The rate of the increase in flooding was significantly smaller with MPC than without. MPC also reduced maximum node flood volume by an average of 52\% for sea level increases of 2.0~ft and above. In addition to the installation of a tide gate, our results suggest that the use of actuators controlled by MPC could significantly reduce overall flood volumes and reduce flood severity at individual nodes in coastal cities.},

  abstract = {Flooding in many areas is becoming more prevalent due to factors such as urbanization and climate change, requiring modernization of stormwater infrastructure. Retrofitting standard passive systems with controllable valves/pumps is promising, but requires real-time control (RTC). One method of automating RTC is reinforcement learning (RL), a general technique for sequential optimization and control in uncertain environments. The notion is that an RL algorithm can use inputs of real-time flood data and rainfall forecasts to learn a policy for controlling the stormwater infrastructure to minimize measures of flooding. In real-world conditions, rainfall forecasts and other state information are subject to noise and uncertainty. To account for these characteristics of the problem data, we implemented Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), an RL algorithm that is distinguished by its capability to handle noise in the input data. DDPG implementations were trained and tested against a passive flood control policy. Three primary cases were studied: (i) perfect data, (ii) imperfect rainfall forecasts, and (iii) imperfect water level and forecast data. Rainfall episodes (100) that caused flooding in the passive system were selected from 10 years of observations in Norfolk, Virginia, USA; 85 randomly selected episodes were used for training and the remaining 15 unseen episodes served as test cases. Compared to the passive system, all RL implementations reduced flooding volume by 70.5\% on average, and performed within a range of 5\%. This suggests that DDPG is robust to noisy input data, which is essential knowledge to advance the real-world applicability of RL for stormwater RTC.},

  abstract = {Stormwater management essentially aims at controlling the surface runoff to reduce water pollution and restore ecosystem integrity. This paper reviews and discusses several optimization problems associated with this field. Different features of such problems were identified to provide a classified investigation of the literature in terms of control approach, performance criteria, stormwater management approach, and uncertainty consideration. Having evaluated the relevant literature based on these factors, the knowledge gaps were extracted. We have noticed that there is an upward trend towards sustainable management of stormwater systems to deal with climate change. Despite this progress, there are still many areas to further develop stormwater management models, many of which relate to uncertainty identification, system-level real-time control, and the proper formulation of multi-objective optimization models. Hence, integration of different criteria in optimization models, and also the study of design vs. operation of stormwater management systems are proposed as further studies.},

  abstract = {Function approximation is essential to reinforcement learning, but the standard approach of approximating a value function and determining a policy from it has so far proven theoretically intractable. In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, independent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams’s REINFORCE method and actor–critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the first time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy.},

  abstract = {Urban stormwater runoff is a critical source of degradation to stream ecosystems globally. Despite broad appreciation by stream ecologists of negative effects of stormwater runoff, stormwater management objectives still typically center on flood and pollution mitigation without an explicit focus on altered hydrology. Resulting management approaches are unlikely to protect the ecological structure and function of streams adequately. We present critical elements of stormwater management necessary for protecting stream ecosystems through 5 principles intended to be broadly applicable to all urban landscapes that drain to a receiving stream: 1) the ecosystems to be protected and a target ecological state should be explicitly identified; 2) the postdevelopment balance of evapotranspiration, stream flow, and infiltration should mimic the predevelopment balance, which typically requires keeping significant runoff volume from reaching the stream; 3) stormwater control measures (SCMs) should deliver flow regimes that mimic the predevelopment regime in quality and quantity; 4) SCMs should have capacity to store rain events for all storms that would not have produced widespread surface runoff in a predevelopment state, thereby avoiding increased frequency of disturbance to biota; and 5) SCMs should be applied to all impervious surfaces in the catchment of the target stream. These principles present a range of technical and social challenges. Existing infrastructural, institutional, or governance contexts often prevent application of the principles to the degree necessary to achieve effective protection or restoration, but significant potential exists for multiple co-benefits from SCM technologies (e.g., water supply and climate-change adaptation) that may remove barriers to implementation. Our set of ideal principles for stream protection is intended as a guide for innovators who seek to develop new approaches to stormwater management rather than accept seemingly insurmountable historical constraints, which guarantee future, ongoing degradation.},
